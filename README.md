DirectX11 C++ visual demo of a Solar System moving, using Rastertek OpenGL and DX11.

All models in the scene are shown using interactive camera control with a separate viewing angle that can be seen by pressing ‘1’ or ’2’ on the keyboard.

Autodesk’s 3DS Max was used to create custom models, such as Saturn’s ring and the [rocket ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIbrA6uyTA) seen floating above the planet models.

Custom planetary textures from ‘[solarsystemscope.com](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/)’, which allowed me to get 4K textures of each planet.
